# D1 schema ownership

`core/migrations` is canonical compact state. `search/migrations` is a rebuildable exact/FTS safety
projection. One agent owns each migration sequence. Never edit an applied migration; add a numbered
migration and a compatibility/readback test. Model, HTTP, R2, Google, and AI Search calls are forbidden
inside D1 transactions.
